Unit 9.5 financial data
This project looks at the stock price for Proctor and Gamble (ticker "PG") and calculates the time period of the data,
log of the daily return, the overall volatility, and the running volatility.

Key concepts: downloading web data, working with time series.
new things I learned in r: somewhat complex custom functions, Return a list from a function, build titles for charts in a summary function.
things I still need to spend time on: when to use lists, matrices, tables, data.frames
